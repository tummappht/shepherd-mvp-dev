This indicates that our test environment is not letting us successfully read from the FluxToken contract‚Äîeither because the chain is not fully synchronized, the contract at address 0x0165878A594ca255338adfa4d48449f69242Eb8F is not deployed as expected, or there is some network connectivity issue.\n\nBecause the view functions are crucial to observing the unclaimedFlux values (which are needed to confirm the vulnerability hypothesis), we have not yet accumulated on-chain evidence that the unclaimedFlux increases roughly linearly with the repeated merge & reset procedure.\n\nTo fix this, we should:\n1. Verify that the FluxToken contract is indeed deployed at the provided address and that the chain (or test network) is fully synced.\n2. Test basic view functions on the FluxToken contract (e.g. using an external blockchain explorer or a direct node call) to ensure that it returns correct values.\n3. If the contract is deployed through a separate process (or if two address sets are available), use the correct/deployed instance as noted by the deployment structure.\n4. Confirm with event logs if the baseline token (e.g. tokenId 1) was minted correctly, possibly by reading VotingEscrow.ownerOf(1).\n\nDue to these issues with retrieving unclaimedFlux, we cannot yet verify whether repeated merging produces the expected linear growth in the unclaimedFlux accumulation. Until the environment issue is resolved and we can successfully query unclaimedFlux for each token (baseline and post-merge tokens), the audit remains incomplete relative to the required testing scenario.\n\nNo FINAL ANSWER is provided until all tool calls and steps have run successfully.',
